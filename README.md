Projects 2023

Hi, I'm Shruti! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) degree in Chemical Engineering (University of Western Ontario). I have recently completed my certification in Data Science from University of Toronto-Waterloo. I am showcasing my data science projects below.

Portfolio Projects
In this section, different type of projects in SQL, Python and Tableau are undertaken. 

## Model for Unit Price of Properties on Airbnb
Description: The dataset contains 48895 records. The list of columns include latitude, longitude, location, room type, reviews, minimum night of stay, host listing count, last review. The following steps were taken: Data loading, EDA (exploratory data analysis), Univariate analysis, Data cleaning, Bivariate analysis, feature engineering, Regression Analysis and Hyperparameter tuning 
    Skills: Data cleaning, Data analysis, Descriptive statistics, Data visualization
    Technology: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit learn, SciPy learn Seaborn, Matplotlib.
    Results: Predicting unit price of properties for the host. Neighbourhood, prices, reviews, types of accommodations play a role in prices of the     property rented. 


## Life Insurance Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithm 
Description: The dataset contains 59,381 records. The columns are employment information, medical history, family history, product information, medical keyword. The following steps were taken: Data loading, EDA(exploratory data analysis), Data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, multi class classification model and confusion report. 
Skills: Data cleaning, Data analysis, Descriptive statistics, Data visualization
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit learn, Scipy Stats, Seaborn and Matplotlib, 
Results: Multiclass classification modelling was used to predict accuracy of the model. Random forest gave the best results.  Modelling helps to predict the accuracy of the risk assessment associated with insurance application as insurance companies are investing in making the process automated. 

## Database Creation with Customer Data, Branch Data and Transaction Data using SQL
Description: Database was created using three different tables. Primary and foreign key was used to join the tables and analysis was done on them. 
Skills: Select, Insert, Delete, Join, Minimum, Maximum, Group data, Count, Average
Technology: SQL 
Results:  Analyzing customer, branch and transaction data based on amount, city for instance.

## Cereal Dataset
Description: The dataset contains 77 records. The columns are manufacture, calories, protein, fat, sodium, fibre, vitamins information. The following steps were taken: Data loading, EDA (exploratory data analysis), Data cleaning and preprocessing
Skills: Data cleaning, Data analysis, Data visualization
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib, 
Results: Predictors of customer rating based on the type of cereals was analyzed using exploratory analysis and visualization

## Time Series Analysis of Financial Data
Description:  Stocks of 4 companies are downloaded using yahoo finance. Analysis is made on the stock price end of month and the next month. Auto correlation and auto shift is used. 
Skills: Data analysis, Data visualization
Technology: Python, NumPy, Pandas
Results: Stock price goes through a cyclic cycle. Correlation is studied for the stock price within the month and extrapolation is done on the price of the stock.


## Default of Credit Card Client using Classification Model 
Description: The dataset contains 30,000. The columns are age, marriage, education, gender, bill amount, limit balance, default payment. The following steps were taken: Data loading, EDA(exploratory data analysis), Data cleaning and preprocessing, feature engineering, pipeline, classification model ,confusion matrix and report, ensemble models, randomized search, grid search and hyperparameter tuning. 
Skills: Data cleaning, Data analysis, Descriptive statistics, Data visualization
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit learn, Scipy Stats, Seaborn and Matplotlib, 
Results: Prediction weather customer defaults on the payment or not. In addition to that ensemble models are also explored. 


## Car Price Analysis using Regression Model  
Description: The dataset contains 300 records. The columns are car type, present price, selling price, kms driven, fuel type, owner and transmission, The following steps were taken: Data loading, EDA(exploratory data analysis), Data cleaning, Preprocessing and Regression analysis
Skills: Data cleaning, Data analysis, Descriptive statistics, Data visualization
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn and Matplotlib, 
Results: Regression analysis was done to predict what factors are effecting the car price. Also dummy variables was created. 
Customer Analytics

## Tableau Public
Description: Tableau Public dashboard consisted of showcasing  customer analysis based on categories and different types of graphs such as donut graph, bar graph, butterfly graph, scatter plot and also showing different regions on map. 
Skills: Creating dashboard and using different graphs to do it. 
Technology: Tableau.
Results: Created an analytical dashboard to support customer analysis based on revenue, gender and category
